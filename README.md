# TerrainTweaks StationAPI for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3

A StationAPI mod for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 that tweaks ore generation, sand generation, and more!
* Mod works on Multiplayer with [GlassConfigAPI](https://modrinth.com/mod/glass-config-api) version 3.0+ used to sync configs!

## Water and Lava Shaping (Enabled by Default)

* Water and Lava can be shaped using wooden bowls:
  * Right click any water or lava block with a wooden bowl to lower its level
  * Lava will consume the bowl when its level is lowered, bring a lot of bowls if you want to shape lava significantly

## Terrain Features (Disabled by Default)
Terrain tweaks need to be individually enabled through the config.
Use [GlassConfigAPI](https://modrinth.com/mod/glass-config-api) to change generation settings.
NOTE: Terrain tweaks do not affect already generated chunks.

* Ability to enable custom biome feature distribution (pros/cons list):

### Tips and Tricks (Cave Ice)
Cave ice can be really annoying to deal with. I recommend using a mod like [GoldenTweaks](https://modrinth.com/mod/goldentweaks-stationapi) to remove the ice.
You could also use a mod like [NowObtainableRecipes](https://modrinth.com/mod/nowobtainablerecipes-stationapi) to get a sponge to soak up the water from melted ice.
This mod also provides water shaping with a wooden bowl that you could use to remove melted ice water.
Another suggestion is to use an alternative light source in ice caves since torches can be knocked out.
